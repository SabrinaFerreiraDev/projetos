          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny’s worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br>never written a line of code. I
          needed <br> some structure from professionals <br>who can help me learn
          programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former
          student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br>about the program.
          The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br>disappoint. They were very
          hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team
          project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the
          next level in a way <br>that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>fact, I’ve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
